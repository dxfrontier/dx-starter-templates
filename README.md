To create a predefined structure for Github actions use the below command line :

`Example:`

```bash
$ npx projen new git_hub_action --from git+https://github.com/dxfrontier/projen-template-projects
```

### 2. Create template for: `CDS-TS-Dispatcher`

$ npx projen new git_hub_action --from git+https://github.com/dxfrontier/projen-template-projects
```
